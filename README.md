# Automatic User Creation
Script used to create users in Active Directory and then create a corresponding Resource Pool and Folder for the user in vCenter.  Permissions for the user get assigned to the newly created Resource Pool and Folder which helps to maintain a least privilege security environment for many users in a vSphere environment.
